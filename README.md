Overview:

A grizzly old man suffering from schizophrenia confronts an evil corporation after discovering they stole his beloved soap, Foamies. With your favorite brush and what little soap you have left, you must battle your way through waves of adversaries and dangerous terrain in order to get back what is rightfully yours. As you ascend through the levels and make your way through the city's streets, your perception of reality becomes increasingly distorted as your mind deteriorates and your schizophrenia begins to impair your senses.

Make sure to turn up your volume and enjoy the ride!
